A simple logical console game, written in C++.
The purpose of writing this console game was to show my skills of objective programming in `c++` language. Thanks to this I could attempt to an end-of-term exam at my University.
## Source code files
- `main.cpp`
- `libFun.cpp`
- `libFun.hpp`
- `libClass.cpp`

## Purpose of the program
Program has to run a *Mastermind* game in two diffrent gamemodes:
1. **PLAYER vs PLAYER** - two players are competing whith each other
2. **PLAYER vs COMPUTER** - player is trying to guess the code, that was randomly generated by the Computer.
This game is about guessing the code, that has been made up by another player. The winner is a player, who has the least amout of points. Each point is gained for wrong attempt of guessing the code.
